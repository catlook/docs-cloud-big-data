General API Information
=======================

The Cloud Big Data API is implemented using a RESTful web service interface. Cloud Big Data shares a common token-based authentication system with other products in the Rackspace Cloud suite. This system enables seamless access between Rackspace products and services.

.. note::
    All requests to authenticate against and operate the service are performed using SSL over HTTP (HTTPS) on TCP port 443.
