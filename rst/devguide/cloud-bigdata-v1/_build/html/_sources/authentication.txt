Authentication
==============

Each REST request against the Cloud Big Data service requires the inclusion of a specific authorization token, supplied in the ``X-Auth-Token`` HTTP header. Customers obtain this token by first using the Rackspace Cloud Identity service and supplying a valid user name and API access key.

To authenticate, you submit a ``POST/v2.0/tokens`` request, presenting valid Rackspace customer credentials in the message body to a Rackspace authentication endpoint.

.. _cbd-dgv2-auth-credentials:

Get your credentials
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use either of the following sets of credentials:

-  Your user name and password

-  Your user name and API key

Your user name and password are the ones that you use to log in to the Rackspace Cloud Control Panel. After you are logged in, you can use the Rackspace Cloud Control Panel to obtain your API key.

US and UK based accounts use the Cloud Control Panel at
https://mycloud.rackspace.com/.

..  note:: 
    If you authenticate with username and password credentials, you can use multi-factor authentication to add an additional level of account security. This feature is not implemented for username and API credentials. For more information, see `Multi-factor authentication`_ in the *Cloud Identity Client Developer Guide*.

.. _cbd-dgv2-auth-global:

Use the Global Authentication Endpoint
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the following global endpoint for authentication using the Cloud Identity service:

``https://identity.api.rackspacecloud.com/v2.0/``

Send your credentials to your authentication endpoint
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you know your credentials and your authentication endpoint, and you can issue a ``POST /v2.0/tokens`` request in an API call, you have all the basic information that you need to use the Rackspace Cloud Identity service.

You can use `cURL`_ to perform the authentication process in two steps: get a token, and send the token to a service.

.. _cURL: http://curl.haxx.se/

#. Get an authentication token by providing your user name and either your API key or your password. Following are examples of both approaches:

**Example: User name and API key**

.. code::  

    curl -X POST https://auth.api.rackspacecloud.com/v2.0/tokens -d 
    '{ "auth":{ "RAX-KSKEY:apiKeyCredentials":{ "username":"yourUserName", "apiKey":"yourApiKey" } } }' -H "Content-type: application/json"

**Example: User name and password**

.. code::  

    curl -X POST https://auth.api.rackspacecloud.com/v2.0/tokens -d
    '{"auth":{"passwordCredentials":{"username":"yourUserName","password":"yourPassword"}}}' -H "Content-type: application/json"

#. Review the authentication response.

    -  Successful authentication returns a token that you can use as evidence that your identity has already been authenticated along with a service catalog, which lists the endpoints that you can use for Rackspace Cloud services. To use the token, pass it to other services as an `X-Auth-Token` header.

    -  If the Identity service returns a returns a 401 message with a request for additional credentials, your account requires `multi-factor authentication`_. To complete the authentication process, submit a second **POST tokens** request with these multi-factor authentication credentials:

    -  The session ID value returned in the `WWW-Authenticate: OS-MF sessionId` header parameter that is included in the response to the initial authentication request.

    -  The passcode from the mobile phone associated with your user account.
          
**Example: Authentication request with multi-factor authentication credentials**

.. code::  

    $curl https://identity.api.rackspacecloud.com/v2.0/tokens \
    -X POST \
    -d '{"auth": {"RAX-AUTH:passcodeCredentials": {"passcode":"1411594"}}}'\
    -H "X-SessionId: $SESSION_ID" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" --verbose | python -m json.tool

#. Use the authentication token to send a **GET** request to a service that you want to use.

The following example shows passing an authentication token to the Cloud Big Data service by using the Cloud Big Data service catalog endpoint that was returned along with the token.

**Example: cURL get distros request: JSON**

.. code::  

    curl -i -X GET https://dfw.bigdata.api.rackspacecloud.com/v2/yourAccountID/distros -d  \
    -H "X-Auth-Token: yourAuthToken" \
    -H "Accept: application/json"\
    -H "Content-type: application/json"

Authentication tokens are typically valid for 24 hours. Applications should be designed to re-authenticate after receiving a 401 (Unauthorized) response from a service endpoint.

.. note:: 
    If you are programmatically parsing an authentication response, be aware that service names are stable for the life of the particular service and can be used as keys. You should also be aware that a user's service catalog can include multiple uniquely named services that perform similar functions. In Cloud Identity 2.0, the service type attribute can be used as a key by which to recognize similar services.
